# Competitive programming algorithms

This repository contains implementations of algorithms that can be useful during competitive programming contests. All the algorithms found here are meant to be copy-pasted into your code, as it is not usually allowed to import any 3rd party code when participating in CP contest. Everything is documented and selected algorithms are defined with C++ templates to be compatible with many data types.

## Available algorithms:
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- FIND & UNION
- Primality check
- Fast exponentiation
- Trie
- Floyd-Warshall
- Bellamn-Ford
- Dijkstra
- Hashing
