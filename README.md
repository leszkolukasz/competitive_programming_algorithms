This repository contains implementations of algorithms that can be useful during competitive programming contests. All the algorithms found here are meant to be copy-pasted into your code, as it is not usually allowed to import any 3rd party code when participating in CP contest. Everything is documented and selected algorithms are defined with C++ templates to be compatible with many data types.
