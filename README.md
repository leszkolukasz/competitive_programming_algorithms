# Competitive programming algorithms

This repository contains implementations of algorithms that can be useful during competitive programming contests. All the algorithms found here are meant to be copy-pasted into your code, as it is not usually allowed to import any 3rd party code when participating in CP contest. Everything is documented and defined with C++ templates so as to be compatible with any data type.

## Available algorithms:
- Depth First Search (DFS)
